Updates will be a bit slow as I have to reboot into Linux to do anything, RISC OS does not have a port of git yet, and the current Webbrowsers for RISC OS are not supported by the web interface for github.

# RISC_OS_Stuff

This is just a collection of little things I write for RISC OS.   The content veries from tutorials to small simple useful utilities to what ever I felt like writing on a particular week, day, month for RISC OS for what ever reason.

This is the initial creation of the repository, so it does not yet contain anything, give it some time.
