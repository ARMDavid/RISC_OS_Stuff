OK I got svn working with RISC OS and github.

# What is here?
This is just a collection of the little things I write from time to time for RISC OS.   I add to this as I creat stuff.

There will be little simple coding utilities, file utilities, graphics tools, programming tutorials, and what ever else I feel like writing as I feel like writing it.

# A Bit About me Relating to RISC OS:
I have used RISC OS more than any other system since the late 1980's.  I am an American, so kind in a vacume for RISC OS systems, and learned to create what I need, especialy as some things are region specific, and no US versions existed for many things.

I have also used Amiga computers as main computers at times in the past, the same for Atari 32-bit computers and there clones (ofton refered to as Atari TOS Clones).  Though I always have continued to use RISC OS no matter what other systems I use.

Currently I use RISC OS 5.23 running on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.  This is by far the fastest computer I have ever owned, and one of the least expensive.
